# niceRplots

This repository contains the functions of the `niceRplots` package, which provides functions to create graphics in the NICE style, inspired by the similar [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot) package. These functions can be used to style static charts created using `ggplot2`, or interactive charts created using `plotly`. 

Examples of plots created using the `niceRplots` package can be found in the niceRplots cookbook

## Installation

`niceRplots` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `devtools` package.

If you do not have the `devtools` package installed, you will have to run the first line in the code below as well.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GitWray1/niceRplots")
```
